# Haystack
**Haystack** is a small searching gem.  It was developed based on work for [Cambridge Systematics](http://www.camsys.com) TransAM Asset Management platform.  It is designed to be

+ driven by rails conventions
+ simple to understand
+ simple to extend

## Setup
Haystack has the smarts to search for you, but you'll need to tell it about your domain.  For this purposes, Haystack comes with built in generators to create the searchers you need.  `rails g xxxx:i-need-to-learn-generator-syntax` will create a UserSearcher model and two view files (a search form and a results view), but that's all that's needed!
